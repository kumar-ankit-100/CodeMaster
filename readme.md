### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumar-ankit-100/codemaster.git
cd codemaster
```

#### 2. Set up the backend
```bash
cd Face_monitoring_Backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Set up the frontend
```bash
cd ../coding-platform
npm install
```

#### 4. Install and configure Judge0
